# Softskills Seminar - Mining High-Speed Data Streams

## Abstract

In this paper by Pedro Domingos and Geoff Hulten from the University of Washington it is discussed how standard knowledge discovery systems are limited in multiple factors and should not be used to extract knowledge and patterns from *big streaming data*, mainly due to memory limitations. New KDD systems should operate continuously and indefinitely, incorporating examples as they arrive and making predictions at any moment in time. Thanks to the statistical certainty given by the *Hoeffding Bound*, it is possible to build a new model, the *Hoeffding Decision Tree*, which is built incrementally and is asymptotically similar to a batch tree built on the same training dataset, with a controllable margin of error. The Hoeffding Tree is finally implemented in the *VFDT (Very Fast Decision Tree) system*, which basically extends the Hoeffding Tree with enhancements for pratictal use. Finally, some empiric results of VFDT are shown.
